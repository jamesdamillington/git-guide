***Guides to using Git and GitHub***

Click the links below to access the guides. Start with _Setting Up Git_ if you don't have a GitHub account or Git installed on your computer. After that you should be able to work through the guides independently (i.e. the order shouldn't matter) 

- [Setting Up Git](setting-up.md)
- [RStudio with Git](rstudio.md)
- [Visual Studio Code with Git](vsc.md)
- [Resources](resources.md)
