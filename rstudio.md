An excellent and more comprehensive guide (which you should really be using over this limited offering) is [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) provided by Jennifer Bryan. That guide itself is [published using Git and GitHub](https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r) via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)!
